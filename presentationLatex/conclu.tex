% We started by examining the design choices made while developing the PRESENT cipher. We looked into the various properties that the S-box of present satisfies and the properties that provide resistance against various cryptographic attack. We examined a differential attack on 16-round version of PRESENT. Implementing this attack was not feasible because of the time complexity and high computation power required. So we implemented our own 3-Round differential attack by using the properties discovered by authors of differential analysis on 16-round PRESENT. We experimented
