\begin{block}{Implementation of DC of Reduced Round PRESENT Cipher}
        We could not find any implementation of Differential analysis on the round reduced version of PRESENT. So, using the idea of differential and filtering taught in the course, we have implemented a differential attack on 3 Rounds of PRESENT.

    \begin{block}{Correlation Analysis}
        We experimented on various side-channel characteristics of PRESENT that could affect the run time of encryption function. Although on initial experimentation, we found some correlation between number of bits high in the key and the time taken for encryption. But, on randomising the messages also, we could not find any effective correlation. We believe that, this should be further experimented, as there are no paper available on this topic.
